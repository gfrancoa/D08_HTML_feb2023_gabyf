        Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML) is part of the family
        of XML markup languages. It mirrors or extends versions of the widely used
        Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the language in which Web pages are formulated.
        While HTML, prior to HTML5, was defined as an application of Standard Generalized
        Markup Language (SGML), a flexible markup language framework, XHTML is an application
        of XML, a more restrictive subset of SGML. XHTML 1.0 became a World Wide Web Consortium
        (W3C) Recommendation on January 26, 2000. XHTML 1.1 became a W3C Recommendation on May
        31, 2001. The standard known as XHTML5 is being developed as an XML adaptation of the
        HTML5 specification.
    </p>

    <h2>Motivation</h2>

    <p>
        XHTML was developed to make HTML more extensible and increase interoperability with other
        data formats. In addition, browsers were forgiving of errors in HTML, and most websites
        were displayed despite technical errors in the markup; XHTML introduced stricter error
        handling. HTML 4 was ostensibly an application of Standard Generalized Markup Language
        (SGML); however the specification for SGML was complex, and neither web browsers nor the
        HTML 4 Recommendation were fully conformant to it. The XML standard, approved in 1998,
        provided a simpler data format closer in simplicity to HTML 4.
    </p>

    <h2>Relationship to HTML</h2>

    <p>
        There are various differences between XHTML and HTML. The Document Object Model (DOM) is
        a tree structure that represents the page internally in applications, and XHTML and HTML
        are two different ways of representing that in markup. Both are less expressive than the
        DOM, and generally XHTML's XML syntax is more expressive than HTML. Because the expressible
        contents of the DOM in syntax are slightly different, there are some changes in actual
        behavior between the two models. First, there are some differences in syntax, and aside
        from these,  there are some behavioral differences, mostly arising from the underlying
        differences in serialization.
    </p>

    <h2>Modularization of XHTML</h2>

    <p>
        Modularization provides an abstract collection of components through which XHTML can be
        subsetted and extended. The following evolutions divide the XHTML language into modules,
        each one grouping together one type of functionalities. This division is designed to
        permit extending the format, or inversely, to extract sub-ensembles adapted to specific
        contexts.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            XHTML 1.1: The modules combined within XHTML 1.1 effectively recreate XHTML 1.0 Strict,
            with the addition of ruby annotation elements (ruby, rbc, rtc, rb, rt and rp) to better
            support East-Asian languages.
        </li>
        <li>
            XHTML BASIC: Since information appliances may lack the system resources to implement
            all XHTML abstract modules, the W3C defined a feature-limited XHTML specification
            called XHTML Basic. It provides a minimal feature subset sufficient for the most
            common content-authoring.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Further developments</h2>

    <p>
        XHTML 2.0: Between August 2002 and July 2006, the W3C released eight Working Drafts of
        XHTML 2.0, a new version of XHTML able to make a clean break from the past by discarding
        the requirement of backward compatibility, notably due to the introduction of XForms and
        XFrames.
    </p>

    <p>
        A ninth draft of XHTML 2.0 was expected to appear in 2009, but on July 2, 2009, the W3C
        officially announced the abandonment of the development of XHTML 2 in order to dedicate
        themselves entirely to its new successor: HTML5.
    </p>

    <h2>Valid XHTML documents</h2>

    <p>
        For a document to be valid XHMTL, it must have a Document Type Declaration (DOCTYPE) and
        a character encoding conforming to the specification of W3C.
    </p>

    <h2>XML declaration</h2>
    <p>
        A character encoding may be specified at the beginning of an XHTML document in the XML
        declaration when the document is served using the application/xhtml+xml MIME type.
        (If an XML document lacks encoding specification, an XML parser assumes that the encoding
        is UTF-8 or UTF-16, unless the encoding has already been determined by a higher protocol.)
        The declaration may be optionally omitted because it declares as its encoding the default
        encoding. However, if the document instead makes use of XML 1.1 or another character
        encoding, a declaration is necessary.
